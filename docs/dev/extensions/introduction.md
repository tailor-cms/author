# Introduction to Tailor Extensions

Tailor supports three main types of extensions, each designed to enhance the
platform's functionality and flexibility:

1. **Content Elements**: These are the foundational building blocks for 
   creating content. They provide the basic structure and components
   necessary for content creation.
2. **Content Containers**: These act as layout containers, typically used
   to host Content Elements. They help in organizing and structuring
   the content layout.
3. **Meta Inputs**: These extensions are used to collect additional data by
   attaching them to various entities within Tailor.

For a more in-depth understanding, please refer to the Concepts section.

This section aims to introduce the basics of developing, installing, and
configuring extensions within Tailor.
