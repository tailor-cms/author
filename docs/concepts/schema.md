# Schema

A schema in Tailor is as a configuration file, representing a blueprint of the 
Repository. It defines the repository's architecture through Activities, 
Content Containers (which are special case Activities), and Content Elements.
This design enables highly modular and adaptable content structures, allowing
content to be Tailored (pun intended) to meet the unique needs of the
target system. A typical examples would be a Course, Knowledge Base, or Article
collection schemas.
