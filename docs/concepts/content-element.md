# Content Element

## Introduction

Content elements serve as the foundational units of content within Tailor, 
residing within a higher-level abstraction known as Content Containers.
One example might be a rich text editor block (Content Element) residing 
within a simple Section container (Custom Container), where Section is just 
a plain array of Content Element blocks.

Tailor out of the box comes with a variety of Content Elements, each serving a 
unique purpose in the authoring ecosystem. Some examples are:

- **Rich text editor**
- **Video Content Element**
- **Multiple Choice Question:**

## Developing New Content Elements

One of Tailor's strengths is its extensibility. New content elements can be 
developed, installed, and configured to expand the platform's capabilities. 

The extensibility of content elements within Tailor significantly enriches 
the platform's content capabilities, offering content creators unparalleled 
flexibility and creativity in crafting content. Custom content elements can be 
developed to address niche topics or present information in innovative ways,
offering flexibility in how content is delivered and consumed. As content 
needs and technology evolve, Tailor's extensible approach ensures that the 
platform can adapt and grow.

For those interested in developing new content elements, Tailor provides a 
Content Element Kit. This Kit includes documentation and tools to streamline the 
development process, ensuring that new elements are compatible and easily 
integrated into the Tailor ecosystem.
