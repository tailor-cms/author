# Meta Input

## Introduction

Meta Inputs are simple data input components like text input, file input,
select input, etc. which can be attached by configuration to Repository,
Activity and Content Element entities. Meta Inputs allow us to describe these
entities without additional coding.

## Example

Let's take for an example 'Chapter' Activity from 'Activity' concept example.

Consider the 'Chapter' Activity from the previous example, within the broader 
'Activity' concept. Beyond the basic identifiers such as the Activity type 
(Chapter) and the chapter's name, additional information might be required. 

We might want to attach inputs to collect information like Chapter description,
estimated duration it might take for someone to complete the Activity, and 
Thumbnail image we want to show. This is where Meta Inputs become crucial. 

By specifying these Meta Inputs in our schema for a Chapter Activity, we make
them available in the Authoring UI, enabling Authors to add additional
data about the Chapter.
