# Content Containers

## Introduction

Content Containers are a core feature of Tailor, designed to offer unparalleled 
flexibility in how content elements are arranged and presented to authors. 
They serve as the foundation for creating diverse and dynamic layouts, 
catering to various needs and complexities.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Content Containers is to allow for custom arrangements of 
content elements. Whether it's presenting a basic list in a novel way or 
grouping multiple content elements with complex logic, Content Containers make 
it possible.

## Examples

### Simple Page

A simple example of a Content Container is a Page. It functions as an array of 
content elements, laid out in a straightforward manner.

### Exam

On the more complex end of the spectrum, we have the Exam Content Container. 
Unlike a simple page, an Exam can include not just Question Content Elements, 
but also additional information like Exam Groups and employ a different layout. 
Content Containers are enabler for a more Tailored authoring experience and
Content Element reuse.

## Extensibility

Like Content Elements, new Content Containers can be developed, installed and
configured within Tailor. This flexibility ensures that Tailor can adapt to a 
wide range of content presentation needs, further extending its utility and 
applicability across different domains.

## Special Case Activities

It's important to note that Content Containers can be considered as special 
case Activities, specifically leaf Activities in charge of Content Element
layout. This designation highlights their role in the hierarchical 
structure of content organization, providing a more granular level of control
over the presentation and interaction with Content Elements within Tailor.
