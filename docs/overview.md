## Development Philosophy

After achieving the primary goal of modeling content to meet any needs, 
Tailor CMS's latest release focuses on enhancing collaboration, reuse, and user
experience.

The foundation of Tailor CMS is built on the extensive experience of `Studion`, 
a company specializing in custom learning experiences for corporations, 
non-profits, and higher education institutions. The platform is crafted to
maximize creative and pedagogical flexibility while minimizing development costs, time-to-market, maintenance overhead, and the friction between building custom
solutions versus buying off-the-shelf products.
