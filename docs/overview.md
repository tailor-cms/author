The foundation of Tailor CMS is built on the extensive experience of `Studion`, 
a company specializing in custom learning experiences for corporations, 
non-profits, and higher education institutions. The platform is crafted to
maximize creative and pedagogical flexibility while minimizing development costs,
time-to-market, maintenance overhead, and the friction between building custom
solutions versus buying off-the-shelf products.
